        <h2>Future Goals</h2>
        <p>My future job goal is graphic designing and to get there I am starting at Scott Community College for 2 years then continuing the other 2 at University of Iowa to complete a bachelors degree. After I have completed college I can get a job that will offer $25 an hour or above, and my yearly pay would be around 50k to begin with. After a while I plan on makeing my own company for graphic designing. When that starts to get successful and I have enough resources I also plan on making my own makeup line.</p>
