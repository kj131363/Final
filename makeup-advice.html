        <h2>How to apply foundation</h2>
        <p>Not everyone likes primers so if you don't you can always start with a moisterizer, the reason for this is to create a smooth base to apply foundation onto. You want to buy a foundation that matches your skin tone almost perfectly, and find out what kind of skin you have (combination, dry, oily) before buying foundations. The reason for this is to make sure you aren't spending money on foundation that might make your dry skin even more dry, or your oily skin even more oily. Some people prefer applying foundation with a brush or a beauty blender, it's your choice. If you are using a beauty blender you want to dampen before you start applying makeup so it doesn't absorb all of your foundation. When you start to apply the foundation don't use a rubbing motion, you want to dab it on.(this blends it all together) When you rub it on it leaves it very streaky and not as full coverage. After applying foundation </p>

        <h2>How to apply false lashes</h2>
        <p>First you have to buy a good pair of false lashes. The brand I most recommend is PUR, their lashes last forver and are very flexible to your lash line. When you first buy false lashes you have to cut them to fit your lash line becasue most are too long, and you want to cut the outer part of the lash instead of the inner corners. The lash glue I love is by Tarte, and you always want to get the clear glue at first if unexperienced and apply a thin layer to the band. You want to let the glue get tacky so let it sit for about 20-30 seconds. After letting the glue sit you want to use small tweezers or your fingers to place the lash on the middle part of your lash line and after that's placed down start to fix the corners of the lashes down. When you have it all set you might have to keep messing with it for a minute till the glue drys completly.</p>

        <h2>Tips</h2>
        <p>You always want to clean your face at night so you don't have leftover makeup in the pores. You should use a facial scrub once every week at least, to get rid of dead skin cells. After use a toner then mosturize your face to prevent dryness. </p>
